description: Final Project completed for General Assembly Python course in fall of 2019. Exploratory Data Analysis attempts to identify any correlation between the availability of Mass Transit Alternatives and the rate of DUI arrests along 6 freeway segments in Los Angeles. # Add post description (optional)

When searching for datasets to work with for a class final project, I discovered that the City of Los Angeles Open Data Portal contains LAPD arrest records going back to 2010. A dataset with over a million rows made and appealing starting point to hone my Data Science skills. After browsing the data and noting the frequency of DUI incidents compared to other crimes, I decided to focus on those data points specifically. 

Los Angeles attempts to rebuild an effective mass transit system, after the Red Car system made its geographic expansion more feasible, have fascinated me since I moved to the city. I decided to combine this longstanding interest with my newly found dataset and explore whether there was any measurable impact on DUI incidents when there is a viable Mass Transit alternative available.

The Jupyter Notebook (linked above and in the Github Repo) follows my process to clean the data, identify additional datasets that I needed and test my hypothesis that the rate of DUI's would be lower on freeways that parallel a Metro Rail line.
