Final Project completed for General Assembly Python course in fall of 2019. Exploratory Data Analysis attempts to identify any correlation between the availability of Mass Transit Alternatives and the rate of DUI arrests along 6 freeway segments in Los Angeles.

The Jupyter Notebook (linked above and in the Github Repo) follows my process to clean the data, isolate relevant data points and identify additional datasets that I needed and test my hypothesis that the rate of DUI's would be lower on freeways that parallel a Metro Rail line.
